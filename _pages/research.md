# Research

At the Robotics Research Center, we strive to extend the state-of-the-art in robotics, control, learning and AI. Our primary research focus is on Multi-Robotic systems, Mobile Robotics, Robot Vision, Robot Mechanism and Control.

### Multi Robotic Systems

Multi Robotic systems have been widely used for carrying out a single task effectively with a team of agents. The central issue with multiple robots is computing collision free trajectories that is investigated in deterministic and probabilistic settings for distributed enviornment. The primary goal is to efficiently achieve the task of mapping an unknown environment using multiple robots.

### Robot Mechanism

Designing mechanisms to transform motion to a desirable pattern and typically develop little forces and transmit little power is of interest in Robotics. Synthesis and Analysis of such designs to determine their rigid body behavior and how this may be useful in an application at hand is the prime focus of this area. Consolidating Design Choices to ensure easy implementation, assembly, maintenance is important. Control of such complicated designs taking into account stationary points in the configuration space, smooth trajectory, force, torque profile-following and energy efficiency are some practical aims.

### Mobile Robotics

Mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. Mobile robots can be autonomous which means they are capable of navigating an uncontrolled environment without the need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices. Alternatively, mobile robots can rely on guidance devices that allow them to travel a pre-defined navigation route in relatively controlled space. Motion planning describes the process of breaking down a desired movement task into discrete motions that satisfy movement constraints and possibly optimize some aspect of the movement.

### Robot Vision

The aim is to develop a spatially intelligent Robotic Vision System. The focus is on dynamic scene understanding both in indoor and outdoor environments and Reconstructing map with moving objects using both monocular and stereo camera. In the Indoor scenario, Monocular SLAM Based Exploration System is being developed. In the Outdoor scenario, estimating the motion of the camera as well as other dynamic objects and reconstructing those dynamic objects and their trajectories with a camera which is moving on the vehicle is of interest.

### Aerial Robots

Quadcopters with their advance sensors and imaging capabilities have become an imperative part of the precision agriculture. The focus of this area is to develop and implement an autonomous system based on a Quadcopter attached with video camera, which can perform plantation monitoring and yield estimation using the supervised learning approach, while autonomously navigating through an inter-row path of the plantation. This system uses GPS for navigation along with advance machine learning techniques over images captured from camera.
