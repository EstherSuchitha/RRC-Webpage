# Research

At the Robotics Research Center, we strive to extend the state-of-the-art in robotics, control, learning and AI. Our primary research focus is on Multi-Robotic systems, Mobile Robotics, Robot Vision, Robot Mechanism and Control.

### Multi Robotic Systems

Multi-robotic systems have been widely used for carrying out a single task effectively with a team of agents. The central issue with multiple robots is computing collision-free trajectories that is investigated in deterministic and probabilistic settings for distributed environments. The primary goal is to efficiently achieve the task of mapping an unknown environment using multple robots. 

### Robot Mechanism

Designing mechanism to transform motion to a desirable pattern and typically

### Mobile Robotics

### Robot Vision

### Aerial Robots
