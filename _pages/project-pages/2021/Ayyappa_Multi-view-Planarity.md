abstract: "It is critical for aerial robots flying in city scale urban environments to make very quick estimates of a building depth with respect to itself. It should be done in a matter of few views to navigate itself, avoiding collisions with such a towering structure. As such, no one has attacked this problem. We bring together several modules
combining deep learning and 3D vision to showcase a quick reconstruction in a few views. We exploit the inherent planar structure in the buildings (facades, windows) for this purpose. We evaluate the efficacy of our
pipeline with various constraints and errors from multi-view geometry using ablation studies. We then retrieve the skyline of the buildings in synthetic as well as real-world scenes."
