abstract: "A crucial challenge in maintaining formation in an autonomous vehicle platoon rests on designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters, especially the friction forces between wheel and ground, which vary with change in road surface, wear in tires and speed of the vehicle. State-of-the-art adaptive controller negotiating such uncertainties can typically handle a priori bounded (or non state-dependent) uncertainties. However, besides the difficulty in accurate modelling and identification of frictional forces, in general, these forces are state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded (e.g., viscous friction). This paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode controller for nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot based vehicle platoon which can handle unknown complex behaviour of frictional forces without a priori knowledge of its parameters and structures. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified in Gazebo simulation in comparison with the state of the art."
