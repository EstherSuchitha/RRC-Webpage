abstract: "We address a distributed adaptive synchronization problem for complex networks composed of nonlinear nodes under state-dependent a priori interconnections, i.e. interconnection terms acting before control design. The interconnection terms are uncertain and the heterogeneous dynamics of the network nodes further contain state-dependent uncertainty
and uncertain input matrix gain. Adaptive distributed control laws are proposed to tackle such an unsolved design. The proposed controller is verified in simulation via a multi-area load frequency control for power systems."
