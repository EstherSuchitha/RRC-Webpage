abstract: "A multi-robotic exploration with the requirement of communication link to a fixed base station is presented in this paper. The robots organize themselves into roles of maintainers of communication (hinged robots or robot nodes) or explorers of the environment ensuring that every robot is in contact with the base station directly or through the hinged robots. A two phased strategy for the same is presented. The first phase is characterized by a recursive growth of trees
that starts from the root node or the base station and then repeated from other nodes of the hitherto grown tree in a depth first fashion. The second phase constitutes the recursive tree
growth invoked repeatedly from the frontier nodes. While the first phase rapidly explores areas around the base station in a concentric fashion, the second phase extends the depth of the explored area to increase the limits of coverage. The strategy is consistent in that none of the robots loose contact with the base station. Extensive simulations confirm the efficacy of the method and comparisons portray performance gain in terms of exploration time and absence of deadlocks vis-a-vis the few methods previously reported in the literature."
