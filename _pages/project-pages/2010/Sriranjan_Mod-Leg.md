abstract: "The Modular Legged robotic system [1] “Mod-Leg” presented here has been bio-inspired from a Snake’s vertebrae and a caterpillar’s legged
structure. The system can be configured to a 4-legged robotic dog, a
hexapod, a caterpillar and a Snake robot. This robot’s novel design
achieves compliance to the terrain using a combination of legs and
electronically actuated universal spine. A unique simulator has been
designed for this purpose. Some of the things we learned while
developing this robotic system have been presented below."
