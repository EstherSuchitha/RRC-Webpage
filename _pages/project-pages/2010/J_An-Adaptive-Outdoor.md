abstract: "An adaptive partition based Random Forests classifier for outdoor terrain classification is presented in this paper. The classifier is a combination of two underlying classifiers. One
of which is a random forest learnt over bootstrapped or offline dataset, the second is another random forest that adapts to changes on the fly. Posterior probabilities of both the static
and changing/online classifiers are fused to assign the eventual label for the online image data. The online classifier learns at frequent intervals of time through a sparse and stable set
of tracked patches, which makes it lightweight and real-time friendly. The learning which is actuated at frequent intervals during the sojourn significantly improves the performance of
the classifier vis-a-vis a scheme that only uses the classifier learnt offline or at bootstrap. The method is well suited and finds immediate applications for outdoor autonomous driving
where the classifier needs to be updated frequently based on what shows up recently on the terrain and without largely deviating from those learnt at bootstrapping. The role of the partition based classifier to enhance the performance of a regular multi class classifier such as random forests and multi class SVMs is also summarized in this paper."
