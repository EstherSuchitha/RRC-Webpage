abstract: "Here in this paper we present a snake robot which can autonomously change its gait depending on the terrain. Also we present the design and construction details for the same. Here a custom simulator for the robot and an API for the same was developed which reduced the
design and development time. For controlling the Snake robot manually a data glove using accelerometers was developed. The Snake robot can also be operated in autonomous mode where an over camera is used for sensing the terrain and the snake autonomously travels from one part of the terrain to another by switching its gait."
