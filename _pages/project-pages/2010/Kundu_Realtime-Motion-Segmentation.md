abstract: "In this paper, we present a practical vision based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system for a highly dynamic environment. We adopt a multibody Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, which is the generalization of classical SfM to dynamic scenes with multiple rigidly moving objects. The proposed framework of multibody visual SLAM allows choosing between full 3D reconstruction or simply tracking of the moving objects, which adds flexibility to the system, for scenes containing non-rigid objects or objects having insufficient features for reconstruction. The
solution demands a motion segmentation framework that can segment feature points belonging to different motions and maintain the segmentation with time. We propose a realtime incremental motion segmentation algorithm for this purpose. The motion segmentation is robust and is capable of segmenting difficult degenerate motions, where the moving objects is followed by a moving camera in the same direction. This robustness is attributed to the use of efficient geometric constraints and a probability framework which propagates the uncertainty in the system. The motion segmentation module is tightly coupled with feature tracking and visual SLAM, by exploring various feed-backs
in between these modules. The integrated system can simultaneously perform realtime visual SLAM and tracking of multiple moving objects using only a single monocular camera."
