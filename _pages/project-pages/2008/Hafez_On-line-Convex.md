abstract: "This paper presents a novel real-time algorithm to sequentially solve the triangulation problem. The problem addressed is estimation of 3D point coordinates given its images and the matrices of the respective cameras used in the imaging process. The algorithm has direct application to real time systems like visual SLAM. This article demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm to the mapping problem in visual SLAM. Experiments have been carried out for the
general triangulation problem as well as the application to visual SLAM. Results show that the application of the proposed method to mapping in visual SLAM outperforms the state of the art mapping methods."
