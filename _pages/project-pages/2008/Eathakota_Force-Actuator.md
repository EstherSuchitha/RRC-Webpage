abstract: "In this paper we developed a model of a Linear Force Actuator based actively articulated suspension vehicle (LFA-V) with toroidal wheels and proposed a strategy to control its contact forces to improve traction on an uneven terrain. We developed the quasi-static analysis for our vehicle and compared the maneuverability of our vehicle with that of a passive suspension system. Extensive uneven terrain simulations depict the efficacy of our proposed system."
