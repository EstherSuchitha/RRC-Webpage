abstract: "This paper deals with the tracking and following of a person with a camera
mounted mobile robot. A modified energy based optical flow approach is used for motion segmentation from a pair of images. Further a spatial relative veolcity based filering is used to extract prominently moving objects. Depth and color information are also used to robustly identify and follow a person."
