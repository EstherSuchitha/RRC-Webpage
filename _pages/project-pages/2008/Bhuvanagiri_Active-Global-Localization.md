abstract: "In environments which possess relatively few features that enable a robot to unambiguously determine its location, global localization algorithms can result in multiple
hypotheses locations of a robot. In such a scenario the robot, for effective localization, has to be actively guided to those locations where there is a maximum chance of eliminating most of the ambiguous states – which is often referred to as ‘active localization’. When extended to multi  robotic scenarios where all robots possess more than one hypothesis of their position, there is the opportunity to do better by using robots apart from obstacles as ‘hypotheses resolving agents’. The paper presents a unified framework accounting for the map structure as well as measurement amongst robots while guiding a set of robots to locations where they can singularize to a unique state. The
appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated empirically in both simulation & real-time (on Amigobots) and its efficacy verified. Extensive comparative analysis portrays the advantage
of the current method over others that do not perform active localization in a multi-robotic sense."
