abstract: "In this paper we develop a model of a Linear Force Actuator based actively articulated
suspension vehicle with toroidal wheels and propose a strategy to control its contact forces to
improve traction on uneven terrain in 3-D while maintaining a desired posture. We develop
the quasi-static analysis for our vehicle and compare the maneuverability of our vehicle with
that of a passive suspension system. Extensive uneven terrain simulations depict the efficacy
of our proposed system."
