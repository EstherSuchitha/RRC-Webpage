abstract: "Overtaking of a vehicle moving on structured roads is one of the most frequent driving behavior. In this work, we have described a Real Time Control System based framework for overtaking maneuver of autonomous vehicles. Proposed framework incorporates Intelligent Planning and Modular control modules. Intelligent Planning module of the
framework enables the vehicle to intelligently select the most
appropriate behavioral characteristics given the perceived operating environment. Subsequently, Modular control module reduces the search space of overtaking trajectories through an SVM based learning approach. These trajectories are then examined for possible future time collision using Velocity Obstacle. It employs non linear time scaling that provides
for continuous trajectories in the space of linear and angular velocities to achieve continuous curvature overtaking maneuvers respecting velocity and acceleration bounds. Further time scaling also can scale velocities to avoid collisions and can compute a time optimal trajectory for the learned behavior. The preliminary results show the appropriateness of our proposed framework in virtual urban environment."
