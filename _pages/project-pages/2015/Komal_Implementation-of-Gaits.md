abstract: "In this paper, we propose a better planning technique of the
standard walking gaits for a quadruped robot than the conventional successive gait transition method to realize omnidirectional static walking. The technique involved planning the sequence as well as motion of the swinging and supporting legs. The relationship between the stability margin, the stride length and the duty factor are also formulated mathematically. The proposed modified crawl gait is compared to the conventional method with respect to the above parameters geometrically as well as mathematically and is shown to have positive stability margin at all times. The successive gait transition is demonstrated on the modified crawl and rotation gaits. Computer simulations of a model quadruped
robot were performed to validate the theory proposed. Experiments were performed on an actual quadruped robot to realize the omnidirectional static walking with increased stability margin."
