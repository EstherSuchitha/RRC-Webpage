abstract: "In navigation that involves several moving agents or robots that are not in possession of each other’s plans, a scheme for resolution of collision conﬂicts between them becomes mandatory. Aresolution scheme is proposed in this paper speciﬁcally for the case whereit is not feasible to have
 a priori  the plans and locations of all other robots, robots can broadcast information between one another only within a speciﬁed communication dis-tance, and a robot is restricted in its ability to react to collision conﬂicts that occur outsideof a speciﬁed time interval called the reaction time interval. Collision conﬂicts are re-solved through velocity control by a search operation in the robot’s velocity space The existence of a cooperative phase in conﬂict resolution is indicated by a failure of the search operation to ﬁnd velocities in the individual velocity space of the respective robots in-volved in the conﬂict. A scheme for cooperative resolution of conﬂicts is modeled as asearch in the joint velocity space of the robots involved in conﬂict when the search in the individual space yields a failure. The scheme for cooperative resolution may further in-volve modifying the states of robots not involved in any conﬂict. This phenomenon ischaracterized as the propagation phase where cooperation spreads to robots not directly involved in the conﬂict.Apart from presenting the methodology for the resolution of con-ﬂicts at various levels (individual, cooperative, and propagation), the paper also formally establishes the existence of the cooperative phase during real-time navigation of multiple mobile robots. The effect of varying robot parameters on the cooperative phase is pre-sented and the increase in requirement for cooperation with the scaling up of the numberofrobotsinasystemisalsoillustrated. Simulation results involving several mobile robots are presented to indicate the efﬁcacy of the proposed strategy."
