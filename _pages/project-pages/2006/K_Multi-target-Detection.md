abstract: "Different methodologies exist to direct the motion of sensors to detect targets moving across an environment in various scenarios. However, some of these do not model that navigation scenario in an environment in which obstacles are present. We extend our earlier algorithm for optimal target detection, as well as other algorithms reported in literature, to this case, and make a detailed comparison of their performance. This makes clear that the current algorithm is  competitive in applications where target statistics are known in advance; otherwise, a heuristic technique by Sukhatme and Jung performs best."
