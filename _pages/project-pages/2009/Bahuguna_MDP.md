abstract: "In environments with identical features, the global localization of a robot, might result in multiple hypotheses of its location. If the situation is extrapolated to multiple robots, it results in multiple hypotheses for multiple robots. The localization is facilitated if the robots are actively guided towards locations where it can use other robots as well as obstacles to localize itself. This paper aims at presenting a learning technique for the above process of active localization of multiple robots by co-operation. An MDP framework is used for learning the task, over a semi-decentralized team of robots hereby maintaining a bounded complexity as opposed to various multi-agent learning techniques, which scale exponentially with the increase in the number of robots."
