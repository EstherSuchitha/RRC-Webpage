abstract: "In this paper we describe the robot software development framework with database at its core. In this framework the features of database is harnessed to make various components modular, and robot data handling and processing is made much more flexible. This empowers the researchers to design the system quickly, access the data and allow multiple collaborators work to be integrated with ease. The advantage of database based framework is explained case by case for various scenarios with example robot application developments."
