abstract: "Secure multiparty protocols have found applications in
numerous domains, where multiple nontrusting parties wish to evaluate a function of their private inputs. In this paper, we consider the case of multiple robots wishing to localize themselves, with maps as their private inputs. Though localization of robots has been a well studied problem, only recent studies have shown how to actively localize multiple
robots through coordination. In all such studies, localization has typically been achieved through constructing a publicly known global map. Here, we show how a similar solution can be given in the case of nontrusting robots, which do not wish to disclose their local maps."
