abstract: "This paper presents a novel visual servoing controller for a satellite mounted dual-arm space robot. The controller is designed to complete the task of servoing the robotâ€™s endeffectors to the desired pose, while regulating orientation of the base-satellite. Task redundancy approach is utilized to coordinate the servoing process and attitude of the base satellite. The visual task is defined as a primary task, while regulating attitude of the base satellite to zero is defined as a secondary task. The secondary task is formulated as an optimization problem in such a way that it does not affect the primary task, and simultaneously minimizes its cost function. A set of
numerical experiments are carried out on a dual-arm space robot showing efficacy of the proposed control methodology"
