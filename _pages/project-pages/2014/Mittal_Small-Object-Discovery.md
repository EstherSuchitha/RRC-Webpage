abstract: "In the field of active perception, object search is a widely studied problem. To search for an object in large rooms, it would be expensive to explore and check each objectâ€™s similarity
with the object of interest. The expense could uncontrollably bloat as the number of objects to be searched increases. If the objects are of the order of a 2-5cm, they appear very small, making it difficult for the present algorithms to recognize them. A general human strategy in such cases is to sparsely identify, from far away ( 4-6m), if the object of interest is present in the scene. Subsequently, each of the possible objects is analysed from closer proximity to recognize, for further manipulation. In this work, we present a similar framework. We reduce search-space,
by identifying existential probability of a small object from a distance followed by a closer 3-D analysis of its point cloud to accurately recognize it. This is achieved by 2-D modelling of the
objects using Gaussian Mixture Models followed by recognizing objects using efficient RGB-Depth based algorithm."
