abstract: "The challenges in generating minimum time trajectory and control for generic quadrocopter flying through sophisticated and unknown environment are explored in this paper. The proposed method uses convex programming technique to optimize polynomial splines, which are numerically stable for high-order including large number of segments and easily formulated for efficient computation. Moreover, exploiting the differential flatness of system, these polynomial trajectories encode the dynamics and constraints of the vehicle and decouple them from trajectory planning. The framework
is fast enough to be performed in real time and results in solution which is close to time optimal. As control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller."
