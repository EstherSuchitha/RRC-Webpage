abstract: "This paper presents a simulation framework for evolution on uneven terrains for a wheeled
mobile robot such as a synchronous drive robot. The framework lends itself as a tool capable
of solving various problems, such as forward kinematic based evolution, inverse kinematic based
evolution, path planning and trajectory tracking. This framework becomes particularly useful when
we understand that the evolution problem (and hence the various associated problems based on
evolution) is particularly challenging on uneven terrain. Specifically it is entailed to bring in the
contact constraints posed by the interaction of the wheel and the ground as well as the holonomic
constraints as the problem is formulated in a DAE setting (Differential Algebraic Equation). The
problem becomes all the more crucial as vehicles moving on uneven terrain are becoming the order
of the day. Nonetheless there has not been much literature that deals in length the various aspects
that go into the framework. This paper elaborates on the various aspects of the framework, presents
simulation results on uneven terrain, where the vehicle evolves without slipping and also presents
substantial quantitative analysis in regard to wheel slippage. The main contributions of this paper
are the motion planning using forward kinematic framework and a new formulation of Inverse
Kinematics for wheeled robots on uneven terrains."
