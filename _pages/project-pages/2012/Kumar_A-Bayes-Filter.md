abstract: "This paper proposes a robust approach for image based floor detection and segmentation from sequence of images or video. In contrast to many previous approaches, which uses a priori knowledge of the surroundings, our method uses combination of modified sparse optical flow and planar homography for ground plane detection which is then combined with graph based segmentation for extraction of floor from images. We also propose a probabilistic framework which makes our method adaptive to the changes in the surroundings. We tested our algorithm on several common indoor environment scenarios and were able to extract floor even under challenging circumstances. We obtained extremely satisfactory results in various practical scenarios such as where the floor and non floor areas are of same color, in presence of textured flooring, and where illumination changes are steep."
