abstract: "Small and medium sized obstacles such as rocks, small boulders,
bricks left unattended on the road can pose hazards for autonomous as well as human driving situations. Many times these objects are too small on the road and go unnoticed on depth and point cloud maps obtained from state of the art range sensors such as 3D LIDAR. We propose a novel algorithm that fuses both appearance and 3D cues such as image gradients, curvature potentials and depth variance into a Markov Random Field (MRF) formulation that segments the scene into obstacle and non obstacle regions. Appearance and depth data obtained from a ZED stereo pair mounted on a Husky robot is used for this purpose. While identifying true positive obstacles such as rocks, large stones accurately our algorithm is
simultaneously robust to false positive sources such as appearance
changes on the road, papers and road markings. High accuracy detection in challenging scenes such as when the foreground obstacle blends with the background road scene vindicates the e¬Åcacy of the proposed formulation."
