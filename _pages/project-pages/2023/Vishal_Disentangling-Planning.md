abstract: "Manipulating a target object using non-prehensile actions presents a complex problem that requires addressing multiple constraints, such as finding collision-free trajectories, modeling the object dynamics, and speed of execution. Previous approaches have relied on contact-rich manipulation, where the object moves predictably while attached to the manipulator, thereby avoiding the need to model the objectâ€™s dynamics. However, this assumption may not always hold, and different end-effectors may be necessary depending on the use case. In place of contact-rich manipulation, we implement the pushingby-striking method (without tactile feedback) by explicitly modeling the object dynamics. Our novel framework disentangles planning and control enabling us to operate in a contextfree manner. Our method consists of two components: an A* planner and a low-level RL controller. The low-level RL controller feeds on purely object-centric representations and has an object-centric action space, thus making it agnostic of the scene context. On the other hand, the planning module operates idependently of the low-level control and only takes scene context into account, making the approach quick to adapt and implement. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm against a global RL policy which is computationally expensive and unreliable to train or fine-tune. To the best of our knowledge, a model-free RL policy without tactile feedback on push-by-strike problems has not been addressed before."
