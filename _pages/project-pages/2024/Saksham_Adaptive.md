abstract: "This paper examines the enhancement of quadrotor efficiency through adaptive Fault-Tolerant Con-trol (FTC) in quadrotors amidst operational uncertainties and component inefficiency. State-of-the-art adaptive FTC strategies often assume the uncertainties to be bounded by a constant a priori, leading to ignorance of state-dependent uncertainties. Unattended state-dependent un-certainties that persist can lead to instability, especially under actuator faults. The proposed adaptive FTC offers actuator fault mitigation while tackling unknown (state-dependent) uncertainties via suitably designed adaptive laws. In addition, real-time fault detection and control allocation are used simultaneously to avoid conservative control application. The closed-loop system stability is
studied analytically and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified on a realistic simulator in comparison to the state of the art."
