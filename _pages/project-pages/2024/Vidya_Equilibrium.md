abstract: "This paper presents a simple method for stabilizing the quadrotor dynamics under complete loss of one actuator using two-stage optimal control. Detailed equilibrium analysis and subsequent selection of operating point under actuator loss are provided, incorporating constraints on the maximum available thrust. A detailed simulation study using a high-fidelity nonlinear model of the quadrotor is presented showing the stability and performance of the closed-loop system under complete actuator
loss, in the presence of external disturbances"
