abstract: "This work proposes a resource efficient robust control scheme for missile-target engagement scenarios subjected to external disturbances. The robustness is achieved by using an annular event-triggered artificial time-delayed control (ET-TDC) methodology with input saturation. The ET-TDC philosophy uses the TDC strategy through a dynamic predefined triggering mechanism which overcomes the requirement to update the control periodically for every sampling instant, unlike conventional TDC and other robust control schemes. Thus the proposed methodology can tackle uncertainties with minimal a-priori knowledge while significantly reducing the over-utilisation of system resources. In addition, the adopted event-triggered mechanism facilitates further conservation of energy which might be crucial for mid-to-long range engagement scenarios. The closed-loop stability is derived analytically and the simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed guidance framework in comparison with other state-of-art robust control methodologies."
