abstract: "Flapping-wing robots (FWR) have domain-specific applications, where the lack of a fast-rotating propeller makes them safer when operating in complex environments with human
proximity. However, most existing research in flapping-wing robots focuses on improving range/endurance or increasing pay-load capacity. This paper proposes a modular powertrain-based flapping-wing robot as a versatile solution to a mission-specific priority switch between payload or range for the same FWR. As
the flapping frequency and stroke amplitude directly influence the flight characteristics of the FWR, we exploit this relation when designing our swappable powertrain with different motor-gearbox combinations and 4-bar crank lengths to obtain the desired frequency and amplitude. We calculate initial estimates for default configuration and simulate it using pterasoftware. We then fabricate two powertrain modules - a default configuration with a higher flapping frequency for payload purposes and an extended-range configuration with a tandem propeller for higher flight velocity for longer range and endurance. To verify the results, we compare the flight test data of both power train configurations using the same FWR platform."
