abstract: "This paper introduces a vision based localization method for large scale urban environments. The method is based upon Bag-of-Words image retrieval techniques and handles problems that arise in urban environments due to repetitive scene structure and the presence of dynamic objects like vehicles. The localization system was experimentally verified it localization experiments along a 5km long path in an urban environment."
