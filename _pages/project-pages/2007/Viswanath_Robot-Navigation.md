abstract: "A methodology for real-time navigation of an all terrain vehicle capable of navigation between floors of a building mediated by a wireless sensor network is detailed in this paper. The map of the building is unknown to the robot. Sensor motes scattered in the building guide the
robot to its desired destination. The guidance is in the form of specifying the next waypoint to the goal by the network. Local navigation between waypoints is achieved by a fuzzy logic based navigation system. "
