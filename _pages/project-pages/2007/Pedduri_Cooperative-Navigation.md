abstract: "A cooperative methodology for collision avoidance of multiple wheeled robots, having respective goals to reach, is detailed in this paper. The paths executed by the robots are continuous not only in terms of positions reached by the robots but also in terms of their velocities. A navigation function is designed that, apart from taking into account goal reaching and avoidance behaviors, also implicitly captures cooperative behavior amongst robots by identifying spaces where collisions between robots tend to be minimized. A search in the joint space of linear and angular velocities of the robots results in selection of a linear and angular velocity tuple for each robot that minimizes the navigation function. Simulated results portray the efficacy of the methodology. "
