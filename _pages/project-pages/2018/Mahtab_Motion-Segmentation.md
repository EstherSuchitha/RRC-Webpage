abstract: "We propose a novel motion segmentation formulation over
spatio-temporal depth images obtained from stereo sequences that segments multiple motion models in the scene in an unsupervised manner . The motion segmentation is obtained at frame rates that compete with
the speed of the stereo depth computation. This is possible due to a
decoupling framework that first delineates spatial clusters and subsequently assigns motion labels to each of these cluster with analysis of a novel motion graph model. A principled computation of the weights
of the motion graph that signifies the relative shear and stretch between
possible clusters lends itself to a high fidelity segmentation of the motion models in the scene."
