abstract: "We propose a novel motion clustering formula- tion over spatio-temporal depth images obtained from stereo sequences that segments multiple motion models in the scene in an unsupervised manner. The motion models are obtained at frame rates that compete with the speed of the stereo depth computation. This is possible due to a decoupling framework that first delineates spatial clusters and subsequently assigns motion labels to each of these cluster with analysis of a novel motion graph model. A principled computation of the weights of the motion graph that signifies the relative shear and stretch between possible clusters lends itself to a high fidelity segmentation of the motion models in the scene. The fidelity is vindicated through accuracies reaching 89.61% on KITTI and complex native sequences."
