abstract: "A methodology for surveillance of multiple targets through a distributed mobile sensor network is
proposed in this paper. We examine coordination among sensors that monitor a rectangular
surveillance zone that is crisscrossed by targets. After a target is detected, monitoring sensors either
remain stationary or begin following their targets. The decision to remain stationary or to track a target
is based on a scheme of priority ascription to the target and the coordination mechanism between the
sensors. The priorities are computed with a fuzzy inference scheme. Coordination between sensors
considers the geometry of the future target path and the number of expected observations a sensor is
likely to make on the target. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology "
