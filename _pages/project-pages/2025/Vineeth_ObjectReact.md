  ObjectReact presents a learned object-relative control approach for visual navigation.
  The method trains control policies that act relative to objects in the scene, enabling
  robust object-centric navigation behaviors. Results were presented at the 9th Conference
  on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025) in Seoul, Korea.
