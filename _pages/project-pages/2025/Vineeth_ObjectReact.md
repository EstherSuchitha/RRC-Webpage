abstract: |
  ObjectReact introduces a learning-based framework for **object-relative control** in visual navigation.
  Instead of learning control policies in absolute coordinate spaces, ObjectReact grounds actions relative
  to objects in the scene, enabling more robust and semantically aware navigation.

  The approach leverages learned object-centric representations to improve generalization and adaptability
  across environments. This formulation helps agents navigate effectively by reasoning about their actions
  with respect to landmarks and objects rather than fixed poses alone.

  The method demonstrates effectiveness on challenging navigation benchmarks, highlighting its ability to
  support long-horizon, object-conditioned tasks.

  *Presented at the 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea.*
