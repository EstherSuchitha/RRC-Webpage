abstract: "Over the past couple of years, with the development of efficient control algorithms, micro aerial vehicles have come into
the picture. In this paper, we consider the problem of creating a map of an indoor environment which provides more information than a 2D map and at the same time is more accurate than the contemporary 3D mapping algorithms. We propose a novel collaborative system, consisting of an unmanned ground vehicle and a micro aerial vehicle, which is used to create augmented 2D maps using the distinct sensing capabilities of these two robots. This system works in a collaborative manner such that the two robots complement each others movement and sensing capabilities."
