abstract: "This paper presents a novel exploration strategy for coordinated exploration between unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and micro-air vehicles (MAV). The exploration is modeled as an Integer Programming (IP) optimization problem and the allocation of the vehicles(agents) to frontier
locations is modeled using binary variables. The formulation is also studied for distributed system, where agents are divided into multiple teams using graph partitioning. Optimization seamlessly integrates several practical constraints that arise in exploration between such heterogeneous agents and provides an elegant solution for assigning task to agents. We have also presented comparison with previous methods based on distance traversed and computational time to signify advantages of
presented method. We also show practical realization of such an exploration where an UGV-MAV team efficiently builds a map of an indoor environment."
