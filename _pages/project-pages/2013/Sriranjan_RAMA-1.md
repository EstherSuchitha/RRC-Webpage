abstract: "Here we present the design of a highly dexterous 48 dof robotic hand. This high dexterity was possible because of the unique design of joints based on magnetic sliding and spherical spheres. The hand is tendon driven and is portable. We believe this is the robotic hand with the highest degree of freedom till date. Dexterity in robotic hands is an important parameter towards the complexity of the tasks they can do. It has been a design challenge to build an anthropomorphic
robotic hand that can completely replicate the human hand in terms of its motion, torque and form factor. Here we have looked at the problem from a design perspective and achieved a hand with degrees of freedom more than the human hand in itself."
