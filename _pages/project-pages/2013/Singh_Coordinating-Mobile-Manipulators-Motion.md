abstract: "In this paper we consider the problem of coordinating the motion of the manipulator and the vehicle to produce stable trajectories for the combined mobile manipulator system on uneven terrain. These kinds of situations often arise in planetary exploration, where rovers equipped with  manipulator are required to navigate over general uneven terrain. Moreover the framework can also be used in situations where the mobile manipulator is required to transport objects on uneven terrain. We generate feasible trajectories for the vehicle between a given start and a goal point considering the dynamics of the manipulator. The framework proposed in the paper plans such motion profile of the manipulator that maximizes vehicle stability which is measured by a novel concept called Feasible Acceleration Count (FAC). We show that, from the point of view of motion planning of mobile manipulator on uneven terrains, FAC gives a better estimate of vehicle stability than more popular metrics like Tip-Over Stability. The trajectory planner closely resembles motion primitive based graph based planning and is combined with a novel cost function derived from FAC. The efficacy of the approach is shown through simulations of a mobile manipulator system on a 2.5D uneven terrain."
