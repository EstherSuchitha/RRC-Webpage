abstract: "Sparse local feature matching is pivotal for many computer vision and robotics tasks. To improve their invariance to challenging appearance conditions and viewing angles, and hence their usefulness, existing learning-based methods have primarily focused on data augmentation-based training. In this work, we propose an alternative, complementary approach that centers on inducing bias in the model architecture itself to generate `rotation-specific' features using Steerable E2-CNNs, that are then group-pooled to achieve rotation-invariant local features. We demonstrate that this high performance, rotation-specific coverage from the steerable CNNs can be expanded to all rotation angles by combining it with augmentation-trained standard CNNs which have broader coverage but are often inaccurate, thus creating a state-of-the-art rotation-robust local feature matcher. We benchmark our proposed methods against existing techniques on HPatches and a newly proposed UrbanScenes3D-Air dataset for visual place recognition. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of the performance effects of ensembling, robust estimation, network architecture variations, and the use of rotation priors."
