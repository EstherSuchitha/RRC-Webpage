abstract: "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing system incorporated with computer vision has demonstrated potential for assisting building construction and in disaster management like damage
assessment during earthquakes. The vulnerability of a building to earthquake can be assessed through inspection that takes into account the
expected damage progression of the associated component and the componentâ€™s contribution to structural system performance. Most of these
inspections are done manually, leading to high utilization of manpower,
time, and cost. This paper proposes a methodology to automate these
inspections through UAV-based image data collection and a software library for post-processing that helps in estimating the seismic structural parameters. The key parameters considered here are the distances between adjacent buildings, building plan-shape, building plan area, objects on the rooftop and rooftop layout. The accuracy of the proposed methodology in estimating the above-mentioned parameters is verified through field measurements taken using a distance measuring sensor and also from the data obtained through Google Earth.
